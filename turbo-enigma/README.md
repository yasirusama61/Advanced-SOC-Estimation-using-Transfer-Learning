# Turbo Enigma: Data Mining Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of data mining and predictive modeling using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to showcase the entire workflow of a data mining project, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalization, feature extraction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing the relationships and structure of data.
- **Modeling**: Implementing machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.
